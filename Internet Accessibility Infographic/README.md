 - I got my data from the World Bank Development Indicators.
 - To create this project, I first built the map showing percentage data using Python, then used Inkscape and Canva to add text and enhance its visual appeal.
 - In this project, I developed an infographic to highlight the issue of internet accessibility. We live in an increasingly digital world, yet there are still many regions where the majority of people have limited or no access to the internet. This digital divide can have serious implications for education, economic opportunity, and overall quality of life.

To begin, I sourced my data from the World Development Indicators, focusing on the percentage of the population with internet access by country. I used Python to clean and visualize the data, creating an initial map that clearly displayed these disparities. After generating the map, I used Inkscape and Canva to enhance the visual presentation—adding contextual information, annotations, and design elements to make the infographic more engaging and informative. My goal was to not only present the data but to communicate its real-world impact in a way that’s accessible and visually compelling.
