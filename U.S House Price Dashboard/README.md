 - The data for this dashboard came from Zillow
 - I used pandas to manage the data, plotly.express to create visualizations, and built the dashboard with Dash, dash_table, and dash_bootstrap_components. The dashboard lets users explore the data in a clear and engaging way.
 - In this project, I created an interactive dashboard focused on housing prices in the United States. I wanted to explore how home prices have changed over time and how they vary based on home size. Using data from Zillow, I built a dashboard that displays the average housing prices across the country over the past 25 years.One of the key features I included was a tab system that lets users filter and view average prices by the number of bedrooms in a home. The goal was to make the data easy to explore so users can see long-term trends and better understand how home size and time affect housing affordability.
