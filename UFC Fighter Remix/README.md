# The Remix

In this folder, include all the files you used to create your visualization (.ipynb, .csv, whatever) as well as a hi-res or pdf version of your final visualizations. 

In this document:
 - Include a large image of your visualization ```![image alt text](.remix.png)```
 - The UFC 
 - Tools used: Python, Pandas, Plotly, Matplotlib
 - In this project I found a graph in the wild that I thought I could improve on. I chose a graph that compared the strike attempts and accuracy of different UFC fighters. I then started to remix the graph in my own creative way. I created a 3-D graph that compared strikes,accuracy, and wins of each fighter. The graph is fully interactive, allowing users to hover over data points and explore the stats in a fun, engaging way. Iâ€™ve also included the full code and dataset so that anyone can replicate or build on the visualization themselves.
